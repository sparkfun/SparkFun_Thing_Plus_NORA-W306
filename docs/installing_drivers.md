!!! warning
    Make sure to manually install the driver for the CP2102N with the following instructions. The driver that Windows auto-installs will not work with the auto-reset circuit on the board and can cause serial uploads to fail.

You will also need to install the SiLabs CP210X Driver, which can be found here: [USB to UART Bridge VCP Driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).
