To take advantage of a few of the built-in components on the board, you will need to install a Arduino Library. Of course, you may need additional Arduino Libraries depending on what you connect to the development board. At a minimum, you will need the following listed below to take advantage of the built-in LiPo Fuel Gauge (MAX17048). 



### SparkFun MAX1704x Fuel Gauge Arduino Library

SparkFun has written a library to work with the LiPo Fuel Gauge - MAX17048 that is built into the SparkFun Thing Plus NORA-W306. You can obtain this library through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for "**SparkFun MAX1704x Fuel Gauge**". Find the one written by SparkFun Electronics and install the latest version. Users who prefer to manually install the library can get it from the  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MAX1704x_Fuel_Gauge_Arduino_Library) or download the .ZIP by clicking the button below:

!!! note
    We recommend using some of the built-in libraries for the u-blox NORA-W306 as well after installing the board add-ons: **File** > **Examples** > <font style="color:gray"><b>Examples for SparkFun Thing Plus NORA-W306 (RTL8720DF)</b></font> . Certain examples like the AmebaWS2812B were written specifically for the NORA-W306 architecture.
